                <p>Born and raised in Germany, Nicole Coleman has always been interested in literature, history and
                    cultures. During her undergraduate years, she spent one year at Charles University in Prague, Czech
                    Republic where she studied transitions to democracy. After she received her M.A. in Political
                    Science (Development Policy), Modern History and Comparative Literature from the University of Bonn,
                    Germany (2007), she spent one year in Montenegro where she taught German language and culture
                    classes at the local university and traveled widely. Back in Germany, she taught German to
                    immigrants in Berlin. Nicole was able to connect all these different interests (human rights,
                    interculturality, migration, and literature) that developed through her studies and travels in her
                    Ph.D. studies and continues to research and teach in these areas at Wayne State University. Nicole
                    has been a member of Wayne State's Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures since August
                    2015.</p>

                <p>As a contemporary fiber artist Heather has focused primarily on color, pattern, texture, distortion
                    and memory. Her use of color and pattern arose out of childhood experiences steeped in the popular

                    published in the books Digital Jacquard Design by Julie Holyoke and Textiles: The Art of Mankind by
                    Mary Schoeser. She worked in the fashion industry for four years as a textile designer at
                    Abercrombie and Fitch and Limited Brands. Macali grew up in Munroe Falls, Ohio and received her
                    Bachelors of Arts in Crafts from Kent State University. She continued her art research and
                    development at the University of Wisconsin-Madison receiving her Masters of Fine Arts in Textiles in
                    2009. Macali currently resides in Detroit, Michigan working as an artist and a professor at Wayne

                <p>Professor Winters has undertaken the hard work of teaching in the general education program. Although
                    she sets very high standards in her Introduction to African-American Literature course, students
                    praise her depth of instruction and rigor. Professor Winters excels as a mentor and teacher,
                    bringing vital new energy to an important area of the department's curriculum.

                <p>I am a sociocultural anthropologist whose research combines urban ethnography with anthropological
                    approaches to environmental studies. My interests include urban ethnography, urban ecological
                    issues, urban parks and green spaces, social movements, and the relationship between globalization
                    and the city. In my fieldwork I focus on environmental and urban politics in a multiethnic district
                    of Paris that is primarily populated by residents of Maghrebi and West African origin. I am
                    currently working on two Detroit focused projects: a community-led “People’s Atlas of Detroit” being
                    done in conjunction with Building Movement of Detroit, and a collaborative project with Dr. Yuson
                    Jung on ethical and sustainable food in the city.

                <p>Tam Perry is an assistant professor in the School of Social Work at Wayne State University. She
                    recently received her PhD in Social Work and Anthropology from the University of Michigan. Her
                    ethnographic research addresses housing transitions of older adults from a network perspective. As
                    health, mobility and kin and peer networks alter, she explores how older adults contemplate their
                    homes and its contents. She studies housing transitions because, while aging in place is often
                    preferred and cost-effective, inevitably some older adults will undertake the emotional and physical
                    labor, as well as the negotiation of medical, financial and long-term care infrastructures, involved
                    in relocation. Her research has been supported by the National Institute on Aging, the John A.
                    Hartford Foundation, the University of Michigan and Wayne State University. She plans to begin a new
                    research project in Detroit on relocation in older adulthood funded by the Michigan Center for Urban
                    African American Aging Research as well as conduct a longitudinal study of older adults who
                    participated in her dissertation project funded by a University Research Grant from Wayne State
                    University.

                <p>My teaching and research focuses on leadership for academic excellence and social justice, including
                    the creation of environments in which democratic organizations can effectively prepare students for
                    participation, engagement and citizenship in a pluralistic civil society and global community. While
                    recognizing the importance of contributing to a body of theoretical knowledge, I am also committed
                    to research that has the potential to improve leadership practice and educational policy, and that
                    contributes to a better understanding of how school leaders in diverse and multicultural contexts
                    can create inclusive teaching and learning environments. Through my scholarly efforts I seek to help
                    leaders understand that social justice involves facilitating the academic success of students as
                    well as attending to the impact of inequitable conditions in the wider society.
