            <p class="text-justify">I am pleased to report that 2018-19 was another successful year for the Humanities
                Center. Our
                achievements include inaugurating a bi-annual newsletter, implementing new strategies to involve more
                students in our programs, increasing our fund-raising activities, and joining other global humanities
                centers in promoting public humanities, and global humanities. In spite of fiscal challenges, our
                programs have all flourished.</p><br>
            <p>At the beginning of the winter semester 2019, the Center launched a new bi-annual on-line newsletter,
                entitled <span style="color: #093f39"><strong><i>THE HUMANIST</i></strong></span> aimed at faculty,
                students, administrators, the public, and social media
                participants.</p><br>
            <p>Our former administrative assistant Tiffany Baldridge created the newsletter. The Center’s vision for the
                publication was to bring snippets of the Center’s work and news to the attention of a wider range of our
                constituents in an informal, pictorial way that is fresh and inviting. The initial edition included the
                Center’s mission statement, pictures from our fall Brown Bag talks, deadlines for winter semester 2019
                programs and stories about significant donations to the Center. We distributed the newsletter widely and
                received positive feedback.</p><br>
            <p>This year, the Center also made deliberate efforts to attract more students to its conferences and Brown
                Bag talks to widen the circle of scholars that benefit from its programs. To that end, we have
                encouraged faculty to collaborate with graduate students in brown-bag presentations and to sponsor solo
                brown bag talks by their mentees, if the faculty mentors are present at the talks and participate in the
                Q&A sessions. We have also had success in getting faculty to assign our brownbag talks and conferences
                to their students for course credit.</p><br>
            <p>In 2018-19, the Center joined with other WSU units in accelerating efforts to raise funds to supplement
                our budget. For example, on April 11, 2019, the Center joined the University community in participating
                in “Giving Day”. We encouraged donors to donate both to the university in general and to the Humanities
                Center. That effort yielded at least $2000 for the Center. We also received gifts of $1000 each from a
                current and a former resident scholar. This year, in addition to its year-end mailings, the Development
                Office will send mid-year letters to our alumni and friends requesting donations. The Center is grateful
                to Provost Whitfield for a grant of $30,000 to help to supplement the Center’s budget. We welcome these
                contributions since budget cuts and increased operational costs have challenged the Center’s fiscal
                health.</p>
            <p>As mentioned above, the Center joined other centers in promoting Global Humanities. The thrust towards
                Global Humanities is an effort by the CHCI, the NEH and other national and international foundations to
                facilitate a rapprochement between the humanities and societies worldwide. The following is part of an
                announcement of its global humanities program, taken from the CHCI home page:</p><br>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“Since 2012, the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes (CHCI), supported by the Andrew W.
                    Mellon Foundation, has advanced multiple forms of international, collaborative research designed to
                    foster new knowledge and new networks. Building upon the first phase of this project (2012-2017), in
                    which 26 member centers and institutes contributed to four distinct projects, and with the support
                    of a new grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, CHCI launched, in 2017, the Global Humanities
                    Institutes, a new program for a second generation of international collaboration”.</p><br>
            </blockquote>
            <p>A variant of this Global Humanities project is a collaboration between the CHCI and the Chiang Ching-kuo
                Foundation (CCKF in China that invited proposals for summer institutes that examine the relationships
                between China and other societies through the lens of the humanities. I learned about this program at
                the 2018 CHCI meeting in Virginia and encouraged Chinese faculty at WSU to apply for funding to hold a
                2019 summer institute at WSU. Within a few months, WSU professors Haiyong Liu, Min Yu and Yunshuang
                Zhang developed and submitted a successful proposal for a 2019 summer institute on “Space in two cities:
                Detroit and Shenyang,” through the Humanities Center.</p><br>
            <p>The following link provided the details of WSU summer institute on “Space in two cities: Detroit and
                Shenyang”
                <a href="https://research2.wayne.edu/hum/CHCI-CCKF.html.">https://research2.wayne.edu/hum/CHCI-CCKF.html.</a>
            </p><br>
            <p>The success of the 2019 summer institute on space in Detroit and Shenyang will serve as a model for the
                Center’s thrust into promoting Global Humanities. In 2019-20, we will encourage other networks of
                international faculty (Arabic, Jewish, Polish, Indian etc. to consider applying for other Global
                Humanities grants offered through the CHCI.</p><br>
            <p>In 2018-19, the Humanities Center also overtly supported and encouraged Public Humanities projects. The
                NEH and CHCI both encourage universities to implement public humanities projects as additional
                approaches to involving universities in ordinary civic life. The public humanities projects conducted in
                universities supplement the activities of the NEH sponsored humanities councils in states across the
                country.</p><br>
            <p>The NEH website carries the following message: <small><i>“Division of Public Programs”</i></small> The
                Public Humanities Projects program supports projects that bring the ideas and insights of the humanities
                to life for general audiences through in-person programming. Projects must engage humanities scholarship
                to analyze significant themes in disciplines such as history, literature, ethics, and art history. This
                program supports projects in three categories: Exhibitions (permanent, temporary, or traveling);
                interpretive programs at Historic Places; and Humanities Discussions related to the 250th anniversary of
                the nation’s founding.</p><br>
            <p>Over the years, the Humanities Center has hosted Brown Bag talks and conferences which seek to connect
                scholarship and art to the Detroit public and other publics. An example was our “Detroit 300” conference
                in 2001 that marked Detroit’s 300th anniversary. The conference theme was “Fueling the Spirit of
                Detroit: Humanists and the Humanities in Detroit’s History”. It had a multidisciplinary focus, with
                presentations from various fields including art, drama, literature, history and archiving. Participants
                in the event were experts from our own faculty as well as neighboring universities and civic
                institutions. More recently, in 2015, the Center held a fall symposium on “Re: the City”. It was our
                most successful symposium to date, attracting two dozen speakers who discussed Detroit and other cities
                from a variety of humanities, arts and social sciences perspectives. Papers addressed “re-inventing”,
                “renewing,” “re-telling”, “re-pairing”, “reimagining”, “re-building”, and “re-envisioning” the city.</p><br>
            <p>In 2018-19, the deans of CLAS and CFPCA in partnership with the Humanities Center funded a Working Group
                in Public Humanities that will provide a focused and enduring public humanities project at Wayne,
                generate faculty and student research, and provide additional connections between the university and
                Detroit.</p><br>
            <p>In addition to the above general trends in its 2018-19 program, the Center continued to manage its
                regular programs all of which did well. Our most visible program continues to be our Brown Bag
                colloquium series. In 2018-19, the Center hosted 51 Brown Bag talks that involved 78 speakers from six
                different colleges and 18 departments. This series continues to be a powerful catalyst for bringing
                together faculty, students and community members from a wide variety of disciplinary and professional
                backgrounds for scholarly presentations and conversation. I am pleased to report that the Center has a
                full schedule of about 59 Brown Bag talks for 2019-20 program.</p><br>
            <p>The theme of this year’s Faculty Fellows’ conference “Design”, was inspired by the fact that in 2015,
                Detroit became the first U.S. city to be designated a UNESCO “City of Design,” a testament to the
                region’s outsized influence in shaping the cultural and creative forces of the 21st century. We were
                fortunate to have Ms. Ellie Schneider, Director of Advocacy and Operations at Design Core as our
                keynoter since she and her group presented the designs that won the award for the city. Design Core also
                donated the graphic images of Detroit sites that embellish parts of this annual report.</p>
            <strong><p>I look forward to the 2019-20 academic year and to the challenges and rewards that lie ahead for
                the Center and Wayne State University.</p></strong>
            <br>
            <p>It is a pleasure to serve you. Thanks for your support.</p>
            <br>
